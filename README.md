This is a bunch of code and notes for day long React workshops in London. [Tickets are still available!](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2016/02/react-workshops-london).

The `lesson.md` file in each folder should walk you through most examples and provide you with exercises to do.

### Credits

A lot of this content was taken / inspired by other publically available examples / repositories online.

- [react-training](https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-training) by Ryan Florence has some great examples; the store example (`middle/2`) is taken largely from that.
- [The React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) are obviously an invaluable resource when putting together React teaching materials.
